// Called every time the results of a person detection run are available. The
// `person_score` has the numerical confidence that the captured image contains
// a person, and `no_person_score` has the numerical confidence that the image
// does not contain a person. Typically if person_score > no person score, the
// image is considered to contain a person.  This threshold may be adjusted for
// particular applications.
